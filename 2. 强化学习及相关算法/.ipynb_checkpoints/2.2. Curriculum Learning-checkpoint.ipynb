    "Humans and animals learn much better when the examples are not randomly presented but organized in a meaningful order which illustrates gradually more concepts, and gradually more complex ones. Here, we formalize such training strategies in the context of machine learning, and call them \"curriculum learning\". In the context of recent research studying the difficulty of training in the presence of non-convex training criteria (for deep deterministic and stochastic neural networks), we explore curriculum learning in various set-ups. The experiments show that significant improvements in generalization can be achieved. We hypothesize that curriculum learning has both an effect on the speed of convergence of the training process to a minimum and, in the case of non-convex criteria, on the quality of the local minima obtained: curriculum learning can be seen as a particular form of continuation method (a general strategy for global optimization of non-convex functions).\n",

    "当范例被按照概念从简到繁呈现时，人类和动物都会学得比随机呈现范例时要更快。我们在这里将这样的训练策略在机器学习的背景下形式化，并把这种训练策略叫作\"curriculum learning\"。近期，在非凸训练条件下的训练难点研究中（对于深度确定和随机的神经网络），我们在不同的情况下探索了curriculum learning。实验结果显示curriculum learning可以使得模型的泛化能力得到显著提升。我们推测curriculum learning不仅能缩短收敛的训练时间，而且能在非凸条件下找到更好的局部最优值：curriculum learning可以被看作是延续方法的一种特殊形式（一种对非凸函数全局优化的一般策略）。"
